					Great news everyone! I have the pleasure to announce you that all the NPC and
					Servant sheets have finally be DONE! Now, all that's left is the mapping!...
					Which is a long and time-consumming process. Especially while using a software
					you don't know, like <a href="https://roll20.net/">Roll20</a>. But worry not dear friends! I can and will do it!
