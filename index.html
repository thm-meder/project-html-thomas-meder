            Hello everyone! It's time to reveal who among the two Caster I proposed you won the contest...
            Aaaaaaand... It's the first one, the old man! Now, to reveal their identity, as promised:
            Our loser of the day was none other than the Scientist of Syracuse, Archimedes itself!
            And now, for our grand winner... I have the pleasure to inform you that James Moriarty will
            be the Caster of this adventure! Thank you everyone for your support, and as always, take care!

     			 <img src="http://via.placeholder.com/200x300/ff3285"/>
           Tough choice, heh? Well, you can tell me who's your favourite among the two. I'll add him to the RP!

            Good day everyone! Yup. You read the title right. Half of the Servant Character SHeets are done.
            Which mean I can add some of them, but not reveal their identity. Just try and guess! As for the NPC,
            I jus finished their stories and character Intruduction. Go check them out! That's all folks!
