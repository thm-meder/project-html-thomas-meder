				<h4>The Game System :</h4>
				<p id="content">
					Each player embodies a Magus able to use one or multiple kind of magic.
					The goal of the game is simple : be the last man standing. To this end, each
					player is followed by a faithful and powerful Servant. There is one catch,
					however; the Servant have is own will and, while faithful, will still act on
					his own. In the worst cae, the Master have 3 Command Spell to force an order
					onto their Servant. However, once the command spells are depleted, the Magus
					and the Servant are not considered connected anymore, meaning the technical
					loss os the Magus.

				<h4>The Battle System :</h4>
				<p id="content">
					When a character try to make an action, he have to roll a hundred-faced dice (refered to as D100).
					If the result is equal, or inferior to the percentage written on his character sheet, the action
					succeed and the damage/result is applied. If it fails, the action is slower/have is damage reduced/
					is stopped according to the type of the action. It's also worth to note that the Servant have a very
					high Health pool and that they deal 3 time the normal damages as a result. So, it is not advised for
					a Master to attack a Servant unprepared.
